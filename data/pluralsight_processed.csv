The AWS Marketplace has evolved beyond just Amazon Machine Images. It now hosts SaaS subscriptions, machine learning models, desktop applications, massive datasets, and more. And billing has evolved as well: from metered billing to private offers to annual subscriptions and more, how you are paying for a solution is just as important a decision as the product or service you are acquiring.
In **Introduction to the AWS Marketplace**, taught by AWS Community Hero Mark Nunnikhoven, you’ll learn the key aspects of buying via the AWS Marketplace. You’ll learn:
* How to find the right solution on the AWS Marketplace
* The key elements of an AWS Marketplace listing
* How to determine the pricing model for your chosen solution
* The ins and outs of license and subscription management
* How to navigate a private offer on the AWS Marketplace
This course aims to inform buyers about how to get the most from the AWS Marketplace. It breaks down the more complicated procurement concepts, so that you can make smart decisions when acquiring solutions for the AWS Cloud.
No prior AWS or procurement experience is required for this course, but a basic familiarity with the core concepts of the AWS Cloud is advisable.
Please note that this course is for those **buying** products or services from the AWS Marketplace. It does not cover **selling** on the AWS Marketplace.",2,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/mark-nunnikhoven',

"When we think of Microsoft, naturally we think of Windows, the Office Suite, tools like Visio or Project, and command utilities like PowerShell. But did you know that over 50% of the virtual machines running on Azure are actually Linux? When you look at the performance statistics behind Linux systems and the potential cost savings, it’s really no surprise.
In this course, we’ll explore why Linux has seemingly taken over Microsoft’s cloud platform and what you can expect when deploying and running Linux in your own environment. We’ll start with the basics of deployments and the Linux distributions you can choose from and continue all the way through securing your instances and automating your deployments.
By the end of this course, you’ll be comfortable planning, deploying, and maintaining Linux based virtual machines on Azure.
This course can be broken down into the following:
* Why Linux is so popular and why you should try to use it in your own environment
* Navigating supported Linux distributions and choosing the best one for your deployment
* Securing your Linux systems using Identity Management, Network Security, and Encryption
* Automating your deployments using both Azure and Linux Native tool sets

"In this class, we will look at various issues of migrating databases and virtual machines to the Google Cloud platform. We will address general techniques that are best practices for migrating to the cloud as well as specific features of the Google Cloud platform that will support migrating databases and virtual machines to the cloud.
In the first section of this class, we will discuss general cloud migration techniques. We will begin with the importance of establishing a solid performance baseline before migration as well as the importance of documenting your candidate system. We will also look at planning a good time frame for your migration and some of the factors that you need to consider when scheduling your migration window. In addition, we will look at some post-migration steps that are necessary to ensure that your system is operating correctly after the migration has taken place. These include running necessary smoke tests, contacting the right personnel, and preparing to establish a new baseline once the system has gone into full production.
In the next section of the class, we will look at database migration and some of the issues that are involved when migrating an on-premise database to the cloud. We will also look at the two major types of migrations homogeneous and heterogeneous and some of the issues that are unique to both of these types of migrations. In addition to the mechanics of performing the migration, we will look at some of the performance considerations when migrating an on-premise database system to the cloud.
Following the section on database-migration, we will begin to discuss the mechanics of migrating virtual machines to the Google Cloud platform. We will examine some of the pre-migration issues that you must consider as well as some compatibility issues when migrating an on-premise virtual machine to the cloud. In addition to the general steps of migration, we will look at the features that the Google Cloud platform offers to support virtual machine migration. Following this discussion, we will walk through two different migration examples of on-premise virtual machines to the Google Cloud platform.
In the last section of this class, we will look at some of the services that are offered by cloud service providers that you will be able to take advantage of to extend the functionality of your system after you have migrated to the cloud. Many of these services are easy to configure and will provide your system with many new capabilities

"HashiCorp Vault is a tool that is used to store, process, and generally manage any kind of credentials. It removes the need for traditional databases that are used to store user credentials. Even though it provides storage for credentials, it also provides many more features. You are able to create and revoke secrets, grant time-based access, IP-based access, and much more.
As part of this course, we will get acquainted with HashiCorp Vault and its features. We will see and examine the life cycle of a secret: How is it created? Where does it exist? Of what type is it? For AWS, GCP, Azure? HashiCorp Vault has specific predefined types of secrets that work well with existing cloud service providers.
Vault provides you with the ability to clearly and precisely define who can access which secret and what sort of access they will have. Do you want the user to only be able to read the credentials, or can the user update them? All of these actions can be logged, and you will be able to see who accessed what and when at all times.
The course will begin with a light introduction to HashiCorp Vault, taking a look at the high-level architecture and then progressing slowly over to basic command-level interaction. Once we learn how to install, configure, and interact with the tool, we will move on to performing specific tasks and reviewing real world scenarios.
It would be impossible to demonstrate all the possible scenarios, but the most common ones will be included such as configuring Vault to work with SSH and provide access, setting up Vault to work with GCP and create GCP-type secrets, and setting up Vault to work with MySQL databases. There will also be an opportunity to analyze how Vault can be easily integrated into third-party custom applications for which there are no specific types of secrets.",23,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"This is the first course of a four-course learning path related to securing containers. This course will teach you how to prepare and harden the operating system so it is secured as much as possible before we actually deploy containers. We will go over various configurations and see how we can use the operating system’s security mechanisms to best protect and harden our system.
In the first part of the course, we provide knowledge regarding firewalld and SELinux. firewalld is a Linux tool used for managing iptables. We need a firewall so we can control what kind of traffic is let through and what kind of traffic is denied. We will go over the firewalld installation and overall setup. Here we teach several basic firewalld commands and how to utilize them regarding zones, ports, services, and other related system aspects. We will also talk about traffic control where we learn how we can allow traffic from one IP to a port, how to allow traffic from a list of IPs (whitelisting), and how to create a list of IPs we do not want to have access (blacklisting), etc. After firewalld, we will move on to SELinux. SELinux is a tool that allows fine control over access to files, controls, processes, or other things on the system. It is used by practically all Red Hat-based distributions. In this section, we will start off by talking about SElinux states, the SELinux context, and context adjustments. We will then go over some useful commands that enable us to list restricted ports and protocols, talk about booleans, port labels, SELinux modules, and logs. Later on in the course, we will also have a section dedicated to firewalld and SElinux automated scripts.
When we have learned the basics of firewalld and SELinux, we will move on to learn about server access and authentication configuration. At this point, we are going to play around with access to the system. In addition to doing some base configuration by just changing the default port we use to connect via an SSH service port, we will also perform changes such as adding extra layers of authentication and creating a jump point server which is similar to a VPN with SSH. We will show how to set up different authentication methods to work simultaneously: standard key-based authentication, password-based authentication, plus a third layer of authentication where we integrate Google Authenticator. We will need our phone in order to log in to the server. This significantly improves our security since it is highly unlikely someone has access to our key, our phone, and our password. We will also get acquainted with jump points. We show what jump points are and what they are used for. A jump point is a place where we connect. It allows us to connect to the rest of our infrastructure. They can greatly improve the security of our front-facing and infrastructure servers.
Furthermore, we also talk about seccomp (Secure Computing Mode). This is an important tool that we will use along with containers and properly impose some additional limitations. We use it to restrict system calls. Basically, it participates in jailing a process and limiting what can be done from the process itself. It gives us the ability to dictate what the process cannot do. After dealing with seccomp, we will move on to a section regarding logs, where we will learn some useful commands to help navigate through large log files. We will also learn about notification systems. In the last section of the course, we will talk about vulnerability scans and reports.",18,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"Nagios is an open-source monitoring tool originally created to run on Linux, but you can also run it on other Unix systems. It was released in 1999 and has over 1 million users worldwide today. Nagios has many features, most of which relate to monitoring. It can track systems, network services, applications, host resources, and infrastructure. It enables you to define parent-child relationships between hosts, create parallelized service checks, define many kinds of event handlers to aid in solving problems, and much more. Nagios is an important tool because you can use it to detect numerous kinds of server or network problems. It assists with finding the cause of problems so you can fix them as soon as possible. In urgent circumstances, Nagios can even automatically fix issues. In short, you'll find Nagios substantially simplifies system monitoring.
The aim of this course is to prepare individuals for the Nagios Certified Professional - Core exam. We do this using different learning methods. First, all necessary material is explained through the videos. You also have hands-on labs in each section to provide you with practical knowledge. Finally, to help you practice and prepare, you have various supplementary materials like final exam practice questions and additional exercises.
There are six main sections we go over throughout the course. The beginning of the course starts teaching you what Nagios is, what it's used for, the prerequisites for using Nagios, and an overview of the most important Nagios terminology. This is important so that you can fully understand key terms like a state, contact group, or acknowledgment. We spend time on learning how to download and install Nagios properly and configuring its many necessary plugins. In User and Server Management, you learn about user administration, navigating the Nagios interface, creating event handlers, host/service groups, reachability, and managing both time and downtime in Nagios. In Monitoring, we talk about plugins, SNMP, and monitoring systems. Finally, we cover NSCA and V-shell to broaden your Nagios knowledge even further.

"Welcome to the Network Routing Fundamentals course! Network routing is the process of enabling computers to transfer data over networks, including the internet. This is an introductory course that is designed to give you a solid foundation in the basics of network routing. We will begin by discussing IP addressing, which provides logical addresses for data to be sent to. Once we have a good understanding of IP addresses and the various network types, we will cover the different types of network routing, the protocols that govern routing decisions, and the policies that are used in more advanced network routing. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how network routing works and how networking decisions are made.

"In this course, we teach Apache web server hardening and cover what web server hardening is and why it plays a crucial part in running a web server. We go over several configurations we can perform to help secure our Apache web server as much as possible. In addition, we talk about the different kinds of vulnerabilities Apache is susceptible to. Apache HTTP Server is a free, open-source web server that runs approximately 45% of today’s websites, which is why learning how to secure it properly is extremely important.
Web servers are in many cases located at the edges of networks, so they are exposed to attacks more frequently than other parts of networks. Web servers are always targeted with requests, both manually and automatically, through scripts. At the beginning of this course, we provide an introduction to web server hardening and teach how to properly install and configure an Apache server. All steps are performed on Centos7, but we could use the same commands for other Linux operating systems. Keep in mind that the installation process is precisely where the process of server hardening begins. It is very important to conduct a proper installation and configuration in order to protect the server and make it less vulnerable. Remember that the default settings are easily bypassed.
Moreover, we also cover how to configure a firewall correctly. We share some basic firewalld concepts and terms like:
- *zones*
- *instances*
- *firewalld commands*
- *blacklists*
Subsequently, we present several other topics. For example, we dive into Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and see why it is important to use it with Apache and how it benefits us. SELinux represents mandatory access controls (MAC), allowing fine-grain access controls for resources such as files, devices, networks, and inter-process communication. In many cases, administrators disable SELinux because it causes complications with Apache, and there is not enough time to configure everything correctly in the system. This usually results in decreased security.
Some practical skills this course imparts are how to create automated scripts, manage apache directory access, perform log examination, and exploit a server using a well-known vulnerability: ShellShock. Automated scripts enable us to automatically perform server and SELinux checks, which is necessary when handling thousands or even millions of Apache instances at once. We create our own automated script for our needs, but we can always incorporate scripts written by others as well. We also create a capture file using the `tcdump` tool so we can recognize if there's anything suspicious going on in the system. If something suspicious is detected, we will then inspect the traffic in Wireshark.
We also cover information over logs. Logging is essential in any system. We share how to configure our own log level for both general and specific traffic. By the end of this course, you will have a better understanding of the Apache server and be more aware of the dangers it's exposed to. You will also be able to set up and configure various parts of the system more securely, as well as search for potential threats.

Then, we'll look at one of the key components of the Google Cloud AI services we'll be examining, AutoML, as we detail its unique features.
Then, we'll dive into specific target categories with a look at the AI Sight services, including those that can detect objects or text in still images or even video.
From imagery, we move to AI services for written language with tools that can extract the structure and meaning of text — including sentiment — and ones that can translate from one language to another, in over 100 different varieties.
The AI Conversation services provide the power to move from one form of communication — speech — to another — text — and back again. In addition, you'll see how Google has brought many of their tools together to create a service that can build conversational interfaces to interact with your users through almost any medium.
In our final section, we'll explore AI services dedicated to another, omnipresent method of communication: data. Within the AI Structured Data group, you'll find a tool for analyzing and making predictions with tabular data, one for recommending products based on user events, and another that can create machine learning models with standard SQL queries.
Obviously, there's a tremendous amount of power and complexity involved in Google Cloud's AI services. Understanding their potential will increase your own for developing the applications, systems, and organizations of the future.

"In this course, we review the methods available to us for securing S3 buckets and objects and how to use them. We also apply best security practices and see what other AWS services are at our disposal to help secure our S3 buckets and even remediate security issues.
Have you ever stumbled across online articles detailing the sad anecdotes of how insecure S3 buckets caused tons of data to be breached?
The reality is that over time, S3 has become a critical service that is highly available and durable and stores all forms of data, whether public or private. With increasing usage and varying use cases, the probability of attacks also increases, which is why it’s essential to learn to secure our data. One thing to remember is that because the use case depends on the organization/user/application, so does the security of the data being stored. So to sum it up, data security in S3 starts and ends with us—the humans.
AWS has introduced tons of features to help tackle all attack vectors; however, it’s up to the user to decide which ones they need to use. You don’t want to restrict access so much that it’s a hassle to let anyone read or list your data, but you also want to make sure access isn’t so open that it allows complete strangers permission to read from and upload to your bucket.",3,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"Welcome to this Scenario Based Docker Security course. This is the second course of a four-course learning path related to securing containers. The lessons that are presented here focus on the security aspect of Docker through which you will learn how to perform various configurations and navigate through different situations within the context of security. Having a proper configuration without security loopholes and having your software sources, such as container images, as secure as possible is very important.
In the first part of this course, we will begin with a guide on how to install and configure Docker properly. We will talk about resource restrictions where you will learn about Linux cgroups and how they can be used to pose limits on different aspects of your system, as well as learn how to monitor resources and process usage. After that, we will move on to Seccomp - Secure Computing Mode and learn how to configure seccomp profiles. Seccomp is a security tool mechanism that Docker can use to achieve additional security.
Securing software sources is extremely important, which is why we will go over the whole process of creating a repository, creating an image, pushing it to the repository, pulling it, doing some changes, pushing it back and so forth, while keeping in mind how to achieve optimal security. This is why we will talk about topics such as creating SSL certificates so that the traffic between us and the software source is encrypted. This will be achieved using Certbot and Let’s Encrypt. We will talk about the security advantages of private repositories and custom images. You will learn how to create custom images from scratch, specifically two images, where one will be a web server image and the other a MySql Database image. After that, we will take a closer look at Docker Bench. It is a security tool that is also used for optimization. When it runs, it performs a series of scans that give you suggestions on what should or shouldn't be fixed.
When all of this is done, the last part of this course is dedicated to deploying and securing an application's backend. These videos can be viewed as a sort of mini-project and review of what has been learned so far. We will be configuring a Docker container to run an Apache web server as an application backend. We will configure a Docker container for which we need to create a custom image to run a Python application (more specifically a Flask application). This application will have an active API that is fully functional and it will achieve a connection to a database for which we will also need to construct a container. So, we will have two Docker containers communicating with each other. We will also set up an Apache web server that will be a gateway to the outer world, so to speak. It will be used as a reverse proxy to allow connections from the outer world to reach our containers. Certbot will be utilized for creating an SSL certificate for our domain.",12,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"Welcome to the Kali Linux Deep Dive course! This course is intended for individuals who already possess general IT knowledge, so be sure to read the list of prerequisites before you get started. Throughout the course, we will dive into the nature of hacking at the hardware level. This is how virtually all vulnerabilities were discovered — by individuals combing through source code or reverse engineering binaries.
This is what sets this course apart from the many others like it. In this course, you will learn how the vulnerabilities in frameworks like Metasploit, BeEF, SET, and others are found so that you will be able to deconstruct a program instead of just trying to figure out how to use something other people wrote. We’ll also cover subjects such as anonymity online and tackle the common misconception that VPN services guarantee anonymity. You’ll learn how to set up and operate your own anonymizing services instead.
In the Social Engineering section of the course, you will learn how to think like a hacker. This is extremely important, as your behavior and thought process determine whether you are an easy target for attacks or a serious cybersecurity specialist no one wants to mess with.
After finishing this course, you will have learned quite a bit, and, at some point, you will most likely have questions. I am always here to help so feel free to reach out and let me guide you on your way to becoming an expert white hat hacker.

"Welcome to this Blockchain Essentials course. *Blockchain* has become a buzzword throughout the decade and has enticed many computer, math, and business enthusiasts, as well as the general public. Most people have heard about it because of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has offered the world a new way of performing transactions of assets (not just money) of various kinds. It has also given us a new perspective on how to resolve certain issues related to these transactions, and how to implement different principles. If you wish to learn, in-depth, the mechanics behind blockchain, to understand the protocols it uses, and to explore its many applications, then this is the course for you. You will be given a thorough introduction to what blockchain really is and what is important to know in order to grasp it. You will learn what mathematics is behind it and what kind of algorithms and protocols can be used to implement a blockchain of some kind. There are a lot of them!
If we retrace some of the events that lead to the creation of blockchain, we can go all the way back to 1962 when Paul Baran wrote a paper about distributed communications networks. In 1982, an interesting thought problem was posed called the Byzantine Generals Problem. It looked for a practical way of achieving communication and consensus between entities despite the existence of attackers or faulty entities. A solution was given in 1999 with the formulation of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm. Then, in 2009, the first-ever implementation of the algorithm was given in the form of the Bitcoin blockchain.
We will start the course off with the basics: the concept of blockchain and the important terminology you need to comprehend in order to really understand what we are talking about. One way we can define a blockchain is by saying that it is a decentralized mechanism that establishes a consensus for past and current transactions divided into blocks. From a developer’s perspective, we can say that a blockchain is a type of data structure. Later, we will dig deep into the underlying architecture of blockchains, and the many consensus mechanisms that can be used to run a blockchain. Be prepared to get into the mathematics of how hashing algorithms work and what they are based on. Prime numbers play an important role in the blockchain world. There will be individual sections dedicated to these consensus mechanisms and mathematical principles. We will also examine the structure of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains so that we can learn their fundamental similarities and differences. As the course progresses, you will see how blockchains can be used for so many different things and situations, not just cryptocurrencies. There will be a section dedicated to these use cases as well.
Blockchains are likely to make an impact in the way we trade assets, store assets, conduct food safety regulation, record patient information in healthcare, perform supply chain management, vote in elections, and much more.

"Migrating from monolithic applications to microservices has its own perks, making it appealing at the very beginning. However, it also comes with its own challenges. And, microservices and containers are tightly intertwined.
Kubernetes, one of the most used orchestration tools for containers, has a lot of moving pieces to worry about — and that's before you've even seen a ""Hello World"" app! Amazon EKS is a fully-managed service that can help you manage your Kubernetes applications through AWS. It also integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like IAM, Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch.
Learning how to manage all of this could be a tough journey. And the more you learn, you may even realize that there are a ton of other things to tackle! This course is aimed at helping you thrive when working with EKS.

"Did you know that, for a long time, Linux has had its own built-in virtualization technology, KVM? In this course, you will gain a better understanding of KVM virtualization on Linux through interactive, hands-on lessons. We will explore four scenarios: workstation virtualization using the GUI utilities, web-based management using Cockpit, managing virtualization using the Linux CLI, and managing virtual workloads using oVirt on CentOS. When you have finished this course, you will have the skills necessary to design, deploy, and manage virtual workloads using KVM on Linux.
Because of the course requirement for nested virtualization, there are no hands-on labs, as there is no support for nested virtualization in hands-on labs. For the same reason, this will not work in the Cloud Playground. Therefore, all lessons are follow-along, using your computer (optional but recommended).

Cybersecurity Analysts are the protectors of our networks. They perform many duties that include analyzing data to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and risks to an organization. They also configure and tune threat-detection tools and secure applications and systems within an organization.
As the skills of cyber attackers continue to grow, so should the skills of cybersecurity analysts. These attackers are finding new ways to bypass our toolsets and controls, therefore, we must continue to adapt and advance our skills in order to combat the attackers and defend our networks.
If you want to advance your cybersecurity defensive skills, the CompTIA CySA+ certification is a great place to start your journey.

"Not many technologies have had the rapid success that Kubernetes has enjoyed in the past few years. By taking the game-changing developer technology of containers and orchestrating them for production, Kubernetes has been deployed in some of the biggest cloud compute projects by some huge household names. But to many people it seems like learning a whole new skill set – what are pods, deployments, annotations, and node affinities anyway?
Don't panic! This course will guide you from the absolute basics of how and why to use containers, to running them at scale with Kubernetes. The heavy lifting of actually crafting a cluster from magic dust and ancient spells is done for you by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), so you can concentrate on deploying your app and seeing it scale to global success. Once you're up and running with your apps in GKE, we'll then touch on some advanced topics so you’re really making the most of everything it has to offer.
In this course, you’ll learn:
* The benefits of using containers for packaging and running applications.
* How to orchestrate containers using Kubernetes.
* Working with stateless and stateful applications, persistent storage, and databases with Kubernetes.
* Advanced GKE features, including regional failover and global load balancing.
No prior container or Kubernetes experience is required – this course really will take you from beginner to pro!
Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus!

"Throughout history, maps have been essential in just about every strategy. They help us understand why we take action, how we can outmanoeuvre rivals and where our escape routes are if things go wrong. Business competition can also be viewed as a landscape, and thus the value chain of customers, suppliers, activities and processes can be broadly mapped. IT is radically changing the competitive landscape and those firms that see the playing field clearly, will be more likely to anticipate the future and deploy effective strategies.
By undertaking this course, you will learn about:
* The principles of mapping and how to relate them to your business
* Value Chains, and their role in defining Strategy
* Evolution in a map (showing how a superior, but expensive solution is inevitably replaced by a barely-good-enough, but commoditized version.)
* The phases of Evolution
* How to anticipate the future by looking at economic patterns
* Approaches to component development — one size does not fit all.
Wardley Maps can help you to better identify uncertainty and associated risks in delivering value to your customers. They allow us to anticipate what’s going to happen in the future and to avoid irreversible decisions that may hamper our operations down the road. Maps help us understand and handle inertia, and to remove unnecessary duplication of effort. They help us to outsource using commoditized components, increasing our ability to respond to changing environments. Finally, Wardley Maps enable us to discover inefficiencies — for example, where people are working on projects to which they’re not suited, and are, therefore, working much more slowly than might be expected.
Keeping your organization fit is not a one-off exercise — it requires continuous effort. Wardley Maps can be applied over and over again, and regular Map Reviews can keep your organization delivering value to your customers by manipulating both your own — and your competitors’ — value chains.

"Hello, Cloud Gurus!
Have you recently been thrown into your first machine learning project and need to get up to speed? Perhaps you’re struggling with all the mathematical jargon in other machine learning introductory courses?
Let machine learning Guru Scott Pletcher guide you through the sometimes intimidating world of machine learning in an entertaining and very non-scary way. Many “introductory” ML courses attempt to explain concepts using differential equations and cryptic Greek symbols--but not this course. This course is specifically designed for people without deep math backgrounds, and Scott cuts through the jargon with simile and metaphor to equip you with concepts and understanding you can put to work immediately.
Machine learning has certainly garnered lots of attention in recent years as organizations struggle to remain competitive in the Information Age arms race. Start-ups, established companies, and cloud providers are rapidly releasing new features and services aimed at ML practitioners. Unfortunately, the ability to effectively use these services to create genuine and repeatable business value is somewhat limited by the availability of skilled practitioners. Compounding matters, much of the available ML training in the market presumes a level of advanced mathematics knowledge which can be intimidating to novices.
In this course, you’ll learn:
* Distinction between artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and statistical analysis.
* The various types of machine learning with real-world examples such as regression, classification, decision trees, and deep learning. We’ll even train a self-driving car!
* How to evaluate and frame business problems for potential machine learning applications.
* Brief survey of available tools, datasets, and resources common in the machine learning space.
* Limitations, potential pitfalls, and ethical considerations around machine learning.
This is an introductory course so don’t expect to walk away solving math theorems like in Good Will Hunting. However, do expect to come away with much greater machine learning confidence and understanding, pulling back that complexity curtain to unveil how all this modern-day magic really works. (Spoiler alert: it’s really not magic at all…)
So Cloud Gurus, let’s take that first step and get started on your machine learning journey.

The Linux boot process goes through many stages before loading the operating system and all of the services that are necessary to interact with the system. The course will begin by covering the evolution from SysV-Init systems to systems using Systemd. This includes how system services are handled during startup, general system use, and how to include or exclude services to reach a specific system state (i.e., runlevels for SysV-Init and targets for Systemd). Then we will walk through the various stages of the boot process starting with the BIOS and UEFI all the way to loading the operating system kernel. This includes modifying the boot process, interrupting that process to gain access to the system, and using different runlevels or targets in order to troubleshoot and recover a system. The course will end by covering other alternate bootloaders that can be used to create recovery disks, perform network booting, and boot from non standard systems such as embedded or IoT devices.

"Welcome to the CompTIA PenTest+ certification course!
What is a penetration tester? Maybe you've been exposed to the idea of being an ethical hacker through movies or television, and this profession intrigues you or maybe you already work in the security field and you'd like to move into a penetration tester (pentester) role. If either of these are true, then you've come to the right place.
Pentesters specialize in identifying and exploiting weaknesses within organizations. Pentesters not only work to discover weaknesses in servers and applications but also in people. To be a successful pentester, you must know how to use a variety of tools, and you should be able to write scripts in multiple languages, as this allows you to write your own tools and create time-saving scripts.
The CompTIA PenTest+ certification course will walk you through the process of performing a pentest. You'll also become familiar with many popular tools and scripting languages.

First, we will discuss redundancy and recovery as it pertains to RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). This includes the understanding the various RAID levels, configuring a software RAID, and managing failover and recovery. Next, we will cover the various types of physical storage and the connections that are used to transfer data. Then, we will discover how to share storage over a network by configuring an iSCSI target and an initiator. Finally, we will learn about Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and how we can use it to group block storage into one logical unit that will give us greater flexibility in allocating storage on the host.
This is designed to be a stand-alone course but is also part of the LPIC-2 201 exam learning path.

"Deploy your infrastructure with precision and consistency using AWS CloudFormation. Make working in large teams a snap by leveraging powerful and reusable infrastructure as code.
This course is designed for those already with a base understanding of CloudFormation and looking to deep-dive into all it has to offer. We’ll look at detailed tips and tricks as well as call out a number of common pitfalls to watch out for.
With over 4 hours of laser-focused course material, we won’t leave a stone unturned. The course is a perfect balance of theory and hands-on examples to keep you engaged and learning quickly.
After completing this course, you will have a deep understanding of the CloudFormation template anatomy including Parameters, Mappings, Conditions, Metadata, Resources, and Outputs.
You’ll learn about Intrinsic Functions, Exporting and Importing values across stacks and templates. We’ll fully detail out how to create, deploy and use Custom Resources ensuring the only limits to your templates is your imagination.
We’ll talk about various deployment options like cross-region and accounts with StackSets or grouping stacks using Nested Stacks.
Next, you will dive into Macros essentially allowing you to run custom functions in targeted places or against your whole template. With Macros, you’ll see ways to extend and automate common tasks, or enforce standards.
Every good workflow needs a great tool to simplify and speed things up. We’ll look at a number of CLI tools out there that will do just that.
You’ll learn all these while working through hands-on labs like creating a serverless SlackBot that can reply with emotes. You’ll then create a Real-time Voting App that uses API Gateway and websockets. Finally, you will challenge yourself to build your own advanced Macro and then implement it into your own template.

"Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and other AWS services.
EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources such as Zendesk, Shopify, or other AWS services to configurable targets, like AWS Lambda and other SaaS applications. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data, which allow you to build application architectures that react in real time with event publishers and consumers, being completely decoupled.

"Welcome to the Scenario-Based LXD/LXC Security course. This is the third course of a four-course learning path related to securing containers. The first course focused on teaching how to prepare and harden our operating system so that it is secured as much as possible. The second course was all about Docker containers and taught how to navigate through different situations within the context of Docker security. This time, we move on to another popular container known as Linux Containers (LXC) where we will get some in-depth insight to how to use them. LXD is a system container manager and an extension of LXC. Today, one is not used without the other.
In this course, we go over a series of best security practices. In order to do anything, we need to install LXC and initialize LXD. One useful security feature of the Linux kernel is seccomp, and we will talk about it within the context of LXC. Seccomp is used to allow and deny system calls with blacklists and whitelists. For unprivileged containers, it adds another layer of security and it is a good practice. Another useful thing we can do with LXC/LXD containers and container groups is limit their resource consumption. We can pose constraints on different parts of the system such as CPU usage, RAM usage, the amount of network traffic going in and out, etc. These restriction options are important because if our container starts overconsuming the resources of the system for any reason and we don't have an alert system to warn us, that can result in a very slow system or our container can end up DoSing everything running on the system.
One practical example we will go through is the process configuring a container to be a tunnel through which we will redirect traffic. It will be an SSH tunnel with private and public keys, and all traffic will go through it. This shields us as the end user from being exposed and encrypts our traffic when traveling between two points.
Another practical example we will go through is the process of configuring and securing a container to run Apache Web Server for an application backend and frontend. We will be creating three separate containers for this: one for the backend, one for the database, and one for the frontend. We will need to configure proper communication between them and ensure we end up using best security practices and strong encryption.",7,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"Welcome to the Google Cloud CI/CD Pipelines course. This course is the third in the Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer certification path. This course goes into detail on what is continuous integration/delivery/deployment and how to implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud services.
In this course, we start by establishing a beginner-friendly, high-level framework of what exactly CI/CD is and how it relates to our earlier course on SRE principles. We go in to a hands-on deep dive of each step of the CI/CD process as we learn about Google Cloud's tools to support a containerized pipeline and build it piece-by-piece. We will conclude with a full end-to-end pipeline that automatically deploys new versions of our application to Google Kubernetes Engine.
Along the way, we recap and provide a different perspective on the topics covered.

"Kubernetes is the open-source system for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized apps at the heart of Google Kubernetes Engine. This integration is totally natural. Google developed Kubernetes in-house and uses it to run its own most popular, global apps. Gmail, YouTube, and even Search run in Kubernetes Engine. It is a fully-managed service and, in this course, you’ll learn it from the ground up.
During this course, I’ll explain the concepts behind Kubernetes and its architecture in detail. You’ll learn what comprises a cluster, how to spin one up, deploy an application on it, and then scale out as needed. Such power needs to be handled properly. We’ll cover multiple levels of access control, from integration with Cloud IAM to Kubernetes-specific Role-Based Access Control. With any cloud computing system, networking is key. I’ll show you how Kubernetes Engine works with load balancers (both internal and external), as well as how to set up a private cluster, and declare a network policy.
Throughout the course, a fictitious company, LA Containers, is used to provide real-world scenarios in an interactive chart, which can be viewed here: https://interactive.linuxacademy.com/diagrams/LAContainers.html.
Additionally, the course describes how to convert the normally stateless Kubernetes Engine so that it handles stateful applications, with the addition of a persistent disk. We’ll also explore the techniques used for integrating Kubernetes Engine with other services on the Google Cloud platform such as Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL.

"In the course *Introduction to Cloud Migration with Amazon Web Services*, we'll learn various techniques to perform cloud migrations. When doing cloud migrations, there are two main migrations that we can perform: virtual machine migration and database migration. This course will have a general section of cloud migration, followed by more specific sections on database migration and virtual machine migration.
The idea of the course is to allow students to follow along in their own AWS environment, if they choose to do so. The course material presents material under a company-wide scope with the given task of performing a pilot project on cloud migration. By performing smaller-scale virtual machine and database migrations, students will learn about the challenges of performing cloud migrations while following company recommendations and move forward to a larger-scale migration.
In the first section of the course, ""Cloud Migration Overview"", we address general techniques that are best practices for migrating to the cloud as well as specific features of the AWS platform that will support migrating databases and virtual machines to the cloud. We begin with the importance of establishing a solid performance baseline before migration and explore the importance of documenting your candidate system. Also, we'll look at planning for your migration and some of the factors that you need to consider when scheduling your migration window. In addition, we will look at some post-migration steps that are necessary to ensure your system is operating correctly post-migration. These include running the necessary smoke test, contacting the right personnel, and preparing to establish a new baseline once the system has gone into full production.
In the next section of the class, we discuss some of the issues that are involved when migrating an on-premises database to the cloud. We look at the two major types of migrations — homogeneous and heterogeneous — and some of the issues that are unique to both. In regards to the mechanics of performing the migration, we explore various performance considerations when migrating an on-premises database system to the cloud. Afterward, we migrate a database using both homogeneous and heterogeneous techniques.
Next, we will take an in-depth look at virtual machine migrations. We look at the various techniques that are used to perform virtual machine migrations and detail the different hypervisors from which virtual machines originate. We explore the various operating systems that can be migrated, followed by an in-depth exploration of file formats used to migrate virtual machines. Finally, we will walk through the migration of a virtual machine from the AWS command-line interface, using AWS VM Import/Export. After performing an import, we will export this same virtual machine out of the AWS cloud environment. The section will conclude by walking through various ways of migrating to the cloud that are used to greatly assist in Disaster Recovery efforts.
This is an introductory course, and while the intent is not to provide an in-depth example on every possible cloud migration technique, it will provide a solid foundation in cloud migration and the skills to move forward with more complex cloud migration efforts.",4,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"Welcome to the Google Cloud DevOps and SREs course. This course is the second in the Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer certification path. If you're coming from the traditional DevOps world, or even from the general computing world, you're likely not familiar with the abbreviation SRE. SRE stands for Site Reliability Engineering, and it's the Google method for realizing DevOps or, in the more formal software speak, ""class SRE implements DevOps.""
Besides SRE, this field introduces a metric ton of abbreviations: SLI, SLO, SLA — not to mention some weird-sounding phrases such as ""error budget"" and ""toil."" During this course, we'll explain what each of these terms means, how they interconnect, and how they relate to the concept of DevOps.
The SRE approach is quite quantitative. But don't worry — we'll explore the exact formulas you'll need to calculate baseline values for each of the key criteria. We'll help you see how Google maximizes the engineering velocity of developer teams while keeping products reliable.
In order to balance development and operations, you need to keep an eagle eye on operations. We'll dive into the various SRE strategies for monitoring reliability with special attention to alerting capabilities. Critically, we'll spend a good amount of time exploring the best way to handle the inevitable issues and incidents that are part of any service lifecycle.
And it's not just me here to help you out. My colleague, Mattias Andersson, will stop by at the end of every section for a quick recap and perhaps a slightly different perspective on the topics covered.
We recommend you have an Associate Cloud Engineer level certification before taking this course.
If the world of DevOps in general or Site Reliability Engineering specifically is new to you – whether or not you're on the certification path – be sure to take this course before diving into our development and operations offerings. It's designed to lay the foundation you'll need before you get hands-on.

"Learning Vagrant introduces students to Vagrant, a virtual machine environment management tool. This course aims to provide even beginners both basic virtualization skills and knowledge and provide a working knowledge of Vagrant and its underlying default provider, VirtualBox. From our first `vagrant up`, we'll create reusable, customizable, and consistent development and test environments, learning how to sync files between host and guest, the network between virtual machines, and provision machines via configuration management tools, and more. We'll also explore using Vagrant as a container management platform through a series of related hands-on labs.
When finished, the learner will be able to create Vagrant environments using a number of providers, provisions, and Vagrant features. They will also have the ability to apply core Vagrant skills to any additional plugins, provisioners, or providers they may need to use outside of this course.

"This course will take a deep dive into AWS CloudFormation, with support from our interactive diagrams to assist in learning. Early on, the course focuses on the basics of CloudFormation, such as templates and scripting languages to write templates: JSON and YAML. After gaining a thorough understanding of CloudFormation basics, the student will shift to deep dives on core concepts of CloudFormation, such as updating stacks and using bootstrapping techniques. Various advanced topics will also be covered in depth, such as drift detection, cross-stack references, nested stacks, intrinsic functions, and condition functions. The course will take an in-depth look at how CloudFormation works with serverless technologies using custom resources, Lambda functions, AWS macros, and the Serverless Application Model (SAM). The sections of the course will start to build upon each other and culminate in the creation of a continuous integration pipeline using AWS Code Pipeline together with CloudFormation to automate the delivery of AWS templates. Finally, the course will wrap up with a look at troubleshooting techniques, best practices, and a focus on how CloudFormation can be a vital part of disaster recovery.

"Google Cloud Functions is a serverless, event-driven, managed platform for building and connecting cloud services. It’s a code-centric service where the functions you write can be triggered by an HTTP request or any number of cloud events both on and off Google Cloud.
At the start of the course, I’ll thoroughly explain what a serverless, event-driven, managed platform for building and connecting cloud services actually means and what it’s capable of. We’ll cover Cloud Functions’ primary features and benefits - one of the most compelling of which is its flexibility, a fact attested to by the wide spectrum of use cases we’ll discuss. Then, we’ll dig a little deeper to reveal what makes a Cloud Function function, including a full discussion of the different types of Cloud Functions along with their component aspects events and triggers. I’ll even go over the pricing of Cloud Functions, something everyone involved in related projects should be aware of.
After you’re thoroughly familiar with the overall structure of Cloud Functions, we’ll begin exploring working with them. I’ll show you how to set up a proper development environment whether you’re on a Mac, Windows, or Linux system and get your first function deployed right out of the gate. Then, we’ll dive into the particulars of coding functions, specifically in Python: how to code for specific scenarios, like working with JSON variables, or particular situations, such as responding to a trigger from an app in another domain.
I’ll give you all the command line code you’ll need for deploying your Cloud Functions, complete with full coverage of the available parameters. We’ll also discuss deploying Cloud Functions from a variety of sources including repositories like Github.
Cloud Functions can be triggered through a variety of methods and one of the most common is to use another Google Cloud service. We’ll discuss how to handle those most frequently relied on, among them Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage as well as some of the more targeted services like Cloud SQL and Stackdriver.
Testing is also critical in any app development and Cloud Functions is no different. We’ll examine several relevant testing strategies along with a look at implementing a CI/CD workflow with Cloud Functions.
The final section of the course really takes off with an in-depth look at a number of different real-world scenarios. These use cases range from retrieving queried data from Cloud SQL, tying together four different Google Cloud services to extract and translate text from images, and integrating with a third-party service to send a text message anywhere in the world all triggered by your Cloud Functions.
I’m really excited to show you all of what Cloud Functions can do and exactly how to do it. It’s a really solid solution for an ever-increasing number of use cases and an excellent tool to have in your cloud computing tool chest.

"VMWare has been the market leader in virtualzation for most of its existence. However, until very recently, VMWare solutions have existed solely in on-premises environments such as datacenters or colocation facilities.
The Azure VMWare Solution changes that. Azure VMware Solution is a VMware verified solution with on-going validation and testing of enhancements and upgrades. Microsoft manages and maintains private cloud infrastructure and software. It allows you to focus on developing and running workloads in your private clouds.
In this course, we will start by discuss the Azure VMWare Solution (AVS), highlighting features and benefits of using the solution, product architecture, and deployment of an AVS Private Cloud. We will also discuss pricing and locations where you can deploy AVS. We will wrap up the section discussing security for your AVS Private Cloud, including integration with Active Directory.
Next, we'll cover networking. We will examine the internal networking components and tools that comprise the solution, as well as connectivity to other Azure services as well as to on-premises environments.
Section four is all about backups. Fun, right? We will discuss Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), which can be used to protect our VMWare workloads without the need for agent installation on individual VMs. Azure Backup server also allows for disk plus cloud backup functionality, and we will get into that as well. We will wrap up the section by seeing MABS in action!
Next up, migration. How do we get our VMs from our on-premises datacenters into the cloud? Does it make more sense to invest in AVS, or migrate directly to Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service? This lesson talk about all of these scenarios, and shows you a real-world example of a discovery and assessment process.

"The marriage of physical and digital technology, such as analytics, artificial intelligence, cognitive technologies, and the internet of things (IoT), allows for the creation of digital enterprise data collected from physical systems used to drive intelligent action back in the physical world.
In this course, 'Hands-On IoT on GCP', we start by understanding hardware purpose, progress to writing software to control the hardware, and finally configure the devices to securely send data captured to Google Cloud Platform.
Why start at the hardware level? Because when using Google Cloud IoT, the Core is mainly about capturing the data from the physical object.
Chapter 2 explores electricity, resistance, and ohms, as well as the basics of using electricity to (1) power sensors, motors, and collectors, and (2) to store that information.
Chapter 3 explores development boards and their differences and capabilities, along with common sensors used to get started.
Chapter 4 explores programming the devices with firmware or immutable instructions that run while the device has power.

"As organizations diversify into the public cloud, the management of their cloud resources becomes exponentially more complicated in a multi-cloud environment. It becomes difficult to manage the who, what, and where of resources being launched in the cloud environment. Visibility into costs incurred and hidden costs from shadow IT become a problem.
So the need has arisen for a unifying platform with one dashboard to manage resources across different cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. This need has been met by VMware CloudHealth.
In this course 'Introduction to VMware CloudHealth', we will show how CloudHealth can be used to optimize our multi-cloud environment. CloudHealth can be used to not only view costs across our multi-cloud environment, but also help us manage and reduce costs. Additionally, CloudHealth can help us with Governance of our resources and provide visibility into our security posture across our multi-cloud environment.
In this course, we will start off with an overview section and answer the question What is CloudHealth and from there detail the benefits of CloudHealth. We will wrap up the overview section by adding accounts (AWS, Azure, and GCP) to our CloudHealth environment. We will learn how CloudHealth gets all of this data by linking CloudHealth to a Cost and Usage Report in AWS.
In the next section, Managing and Reporint Costs, we look at budgeting and forecasting and also cost reporting. These three elements tie closely together and the accuracy of the data we feed to these elements is crucial.
In the next section, we discuss governance of our multi-cloud environment. Lessons include 'Managing Cloud Assets and Configurtion', and 'Using Policies and Actions to Enforce Governance', and policies coupled with actions can enable automation.
In the final sction, 'Securing Cloud Infrastructure', we look at using policies to enhance our security posture, and using CloudHealth reports for security.

"Greetings, one and all! Allow me to introduce you to my course, *Hands-On with Google Cloud Functions*. I can’t wait to show you how to use the serverless, code-centric features of Cloud Functions to connect multiple services and APIs, both on and off Google Cloud.
I’m Joe Lowery, Senior Training Architect with Pluralsight, specializing in Google Cloud. I’ve been working with Google Cloud for over eight years now, and I am a Certified Professional Cloud Architect who has created dozens of courses and a ton of hands-on labs — all focused on Google Cloud.
We'll start by diving deep into the foundation of the service so that you know how to get the most out of it. As you'll see throughout this course, Cloud Functions are powerfully flexible — and even more so with the new 2nd gen environment.
Of course, Cloud Functions are all about the code, so we'll cover what you need to know to program a range of functions, whether you're triggering your function directly with an HTTP call or relying on one of the many CloudEvents to kick it off.
Cloud Functions are an essential tool for putting your data to work, whether that data is stored in a relational database, like Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner, or a non-relational NoSQL service, such as Cloud Bigtable or Cloud Firestore.
Finally, we'll explore connecting Cloud Functions to a slew of Google Cloud AI services and machine learning APIs, like Dialogflow and the Video Intelligence API.
Because this is *Hands-on with Google Cloud Functions*, there are a slew of hands-on labs for you to experience — whether you're deploying a Pub/Sub-triggered function via Terraform, securely connecting a Cloud Function to a VPC network, or sending an SMS text via a third-party service — all that and so much more!
The goal of this course is to give you the knowledge and the experience you need, so you can incorporate Cloud Functions efficiently into your Google Cloud workflow.
Here's what you'll need to know to get the most out of this course:
* A solid understanding of the Google Cloud Platform
* Basic knowledge of how Cloud Functions work
* Fundamental coding skills in a supported language, such as Python
So, what are you waiting for? Let's get *Hands-On with Google Cloud Functions*!",11,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/joseph-lowery',

"Welcome to this course, _Creating Startup Scripts for VMs with Cloud-init_ using Azure VMs.
Cloud-init is a popular open source approach to customizing a Linux VM on its very first boot. It can perform a wide range of actions such as installing applications, creating users, performing security actions, and much more across multiple versions of Linux. It is also natively supported on Azure Linux virtual machines and does not require extensions or additional agents to use it.
With that said, there is a bit of a learning curve when formatting cloud-init configuration files as it uses a format called _MODULES_, which is different from the bash scripts that you may be used to. The objective of this course is to demystify how to create cloud-init configurations and use them to automatically configure new VMs.

"Hello Cloud Gurus!
Like on-premises infrastructures, modern Cloud infrastructures are a tangle of diverse, interdependent components: to work in harmony, instances, storage, load balancers, firewalls, databases, and content delivery networks must be correctly provisioned and configured — a historically manual process that’s complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.
This brand-new course is an introduction to AWS CloudFormation, which automates the provisioning of your AWS Infrastructure. Once you’ve specified your infrastructure in a reusable JSON or YAML template, CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, removing the need for manual actions or custom scripts.
With this course, you will:
* Learn what AWS CloudFormation is, and the benefits it provides
* Understand the anatomy of a CloudFormation Template
* Read and write your own CloudFormation templates
* Learn how to make templates reusable
* Understand the creation and use of nested templates
* Update and delete your CloudFormation Stacks.
Since this is just an introduction, we won’t be going too deep in this course, but you will gain enough knowledge and practice to start using it in your projects. No prior coding experience is required.",3,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/abhaya-chauhan',

"Welcome to this certification course on Microsoft’s **AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions**.
This course will prepare you to pass your exam and prove your skills in designing, governing, and migrating to reliable, scalable, secure, and performant solutions within Azure. Throughout the course, we’ll learn about the services, features, pricing, and licensing you’ll need to know for the exam, and also how you can apply the knowledge you gain when architecting Azure solutions in the real world.
This course will cover the following domains:
* **Design identity, governance, and monitoring solutions**
* **Design data storage solutions**
* **Design business continuity solutions**
* **Design infrastructure solutions**
Passing the AZ-305 exam, and gaining your Azure Administrator Associate certification, will allow you to earn your Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification.
While you do not have to have achieved your Azure Administrator Associate certification to sit the AZ-305 exam, it is considered a prerequisite for the expert certification. For this course, you need to already be familiar with deployment, configuration, and implementation of various Azure services. For example, when discussing how to design a compute-based solution in this course, we will consider various compute services, key features, pricing, and when you might use these services. While some time will be spent demonstrating these services, our focus is on key features, and not configuration or administration.
We’ll go through a variety of subtopics in each domain, using previous lessons as part of the foundation for the next topic. You will gain a practical knowledge of how these pieces fit together and how you can design solutions to common problems faced in enterprises today.
You'll get experience with hands-on labs to solidify your knowledge, and you can look forward to practice questions throughout the course to ensure you’re ready to move on.
So with all of that being said, it's time to jump in and get started on becoming an Azure Solutions Architect Expert.

"Join me as we tour the solar system in pursuit of greater cosmic knowledge... or at least greater knowledge of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL!
This course is designed to prepare you to sit for and pass the DP-420 exam in pursuit of the *Microsoft Certified: Azure Cosmos DB Developer Specialty* certification.
Throughout the lectures, demos, labs, and quizzes in this course, you'll prove and improve your skills in developing applications for Azure Cosmos DB, writing efficient SQL queries, and creating appropriate indexing policies. You will also gain experience in server-side objects and hone your ability to intepret JSON, read C# or Java code, and use PowerShell and the Azure CLI.
The exam covers the five domains defined by Microsoft for mastery of the exam material:
* Design and implement data models
* Design and implement data distribution
* Integrate an Azure Cosmos DB solution
* Optimize an Azure Cosmos DB solution
* Maintain an Azure Cosmos DB solution
#### What You Bring
All of this does assume you have a baseline knowledge of cloud concepts in general and solutions in Azure in particular. And of course, for a certification designed for developers, you’re expected to have hands-on coding experience. Throughout the course lectures and most labs, we assume that you have at least a novice understanding and application of at least some SQL, C#, or a similar object-oriented language, and, ideally, JavaScript and some command-line experience, as well. No prior certifications are required, but students who hold other Microsoft database or programming certifications will have a head start.
Within each domain are a variety of subtopics that we’ll cover in greater detail throughout the course.

"Hello, and welcome to the LPIC-2 Linux Engineer Exam 201! This course has been designed to cover all the objectives for the LPIC-2 201 exam. It begins with capacity planning, which includes utilities and concepts for measuring resource usage and predicting future resource needs.
Then, we move on to the Linux kernel and system startup. These sections cover the boot process from BIOS, to the kernel, all the way to initializing system services.
Next, we have a section on filesystems and devices, which focuses on creating and managing filesystems. This leads us to advanced storage and device administration, which includes RAID, iSCSI, and logical volume management.
The last two sections are network configuration and system maintenance. Network configuration begins by covering utilities for the basic management of wired and wireless interfaces and then moves on to more advanced concepts and techniques. In the section on system maintenance, we will learn how to make and install programs from source, back up important data, and notify users of system-related issues.
Once you’ve completed this course, you will be prepared to sit and pass the LPIC-2 201 exam. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to seeing you in the course!",13,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cloud-content',

"Welcome to the certification preparation course for Microsoft’s **AZ-700: Designing and Implementing Microsoft Azure Networking Solutions** exam, which helps you obtain the **Microsoft Certified: Azure Network Engineer Associate** certification.
This course is designed to prepare you to sit for and pass the AZ-700 exam and to prove your skills in planning, implementing, and maintaining Azure networking solutions, including hybrid networking, connectivity, routing, security, and private access to Azure services. Throughout the course, we’ll take a thorough look at the technologies you’ll need to know for the exam and help you not only understand what each service does, but also how you can apply the knowledge you gain here in your own network environments.
This course will cover the following domains:
* **Design, Implement, and Manage Hybrid Networking**
* **Design and Implement Core Networking Infrastructure**
* **Design and Implement Routing**
* **Secure and Monitor Networks**
* **Design and Implement Private Access to Azure Services**
This course is focused on securing solutions built within Azure, and so it is expected that you are already familiar with basic deployment, configuration, and implementation of several Azure services. For example, when discussing how to protect a virtual machine, we will focus on the features, services, and configuration required to do so. In this case, it is expected that you would already know how to get a virtual machine up and running.
As such, it is recommended that you have either obtained the **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate** certification or have a similar level of experience and familiarity working with and configuring services within Azure.
Within each domain are a variety of subtopics that we’ll cover in greater detail throughout the course. We’ll go through each domain, using each previous lesson as part of the foundation for the next topic. This prepares you not only to answer questions correctly on the exam, but also to have a practical knowledge of how these pieces fit together and how you can design solutions to common problems faced in enterprises today.
You'll get experience with hands-on labs to solidify your knowledge, and you can look forward to practice questions throughout the course to ensure you’re ready to move on.
So with all of that being said, it's time to jump in and get started on becoming an Azure network engineer!",4,"{'instructor_link': 'https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/matthew-ulasien',

"Do you manage your own email systems? Then greylisting is for you.
Those who send out junk emails make money when people open and respond to those emails. They need to get that junk email sent and opened as fast as possible, because they know that after a short period of time, their emails will be marked as junk mail and will be automatically moved by email providers into people's junk folders.
Hackers and those with bad intentions also send out bulk emails. They find a vulnerability and send out bulk emails hoping that someone will click on an email link and expose themselves to the security flaw.
If you're in one of these groups (sending out hundreds of thousands or millions of bulk emails in one bunch), then your systems are designed for throughput. These bad actors send their payloads out into the world using their lists of millions of emails, and if they get no response by a defined time limit or get a retry later message, then they skip that email and move on to the next in their list. Depending on whether spammers want to make their process as fast and efficient as possible (time is money to them), they may also remove email addresses from their list that are not able to receive email instantly.
Email greylisting is a method to lower the amount of spam and junk mail that gets into your email inbox. It works by slightly delaying the emails being received and forcing the sender to resend the emails.
If this sounds interesting to you, then jump into this course to see if it can help cut down your spam and increase the security of your email systems.

"Hello Cloud Gurus!
Data management, data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are all hot topics. And who does these better than Google? Our Google Certified Professional Data Engineer course will help prepare you for the certification exam so you can take that next step in your Cloud career and demonstrate your proficiency in one of the most in-demand disciplines in the industry today.
The primary focus of this course is to prepare you for the GCP Professional Data Engineer certification exam. Along the way you’ll solidify your foundations in data engineering and machine learning, ensuring that by the end of the course you will be able to design and build data processing solutions, operationalize machine learning models and gain a working knowledge of relevant GCP data processing tools and technologies.
This course will teach you how to:
* Design, build and operationalize data solutions
* Process data streams in real-time
* Efficiently store and access data in the cloud
* Use the GCP pre-trained AI APIs (vision, speech and text)
* Train and operationalize ML models.
The Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer is for data scientists, solution architects, devops engineers and anyone wanting to move into machine learning and data engineering in the context of Google. Students will need to have some familiarity with the basics of GCP, such as: storage, compute and security; some basic coding skills (like Python); and a good understanding of databases. You do not need to have a background in data engineering or machine learning, but some experience with GCP is essential. This is an advanced certification and we strongly recommend that students take the Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer exam before embarking on this course. However, anyone who is motivated and wants to understand how big data and machine learning is done on GCP will still find value with this course.
Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus!

"Hello Cloud Gurus,
Graph Databases like Amazon Neptune are incredibly powerful but relatively underappreciated. In this course, we will dive in to Neptune to see how and why it might be right for your Serverless applications. At the end of this course you will be able to spin up a Graph Database stack and a simple web application to leverage your graph data. We’ll achieve this with serverless framework and cloudformation, meaning you learn a lot more than just one AWS service in this course!
The app we build is also great fun and very practical. It’s a face categorisation app using family photographs (you can use your own if you like, or use the supplied images), leveraging data that we will generate from the Amazon Rekognition service. With this tool we might just be able to finally sort out those hundreds of thousands of family photos that we all have lying around. Now you can easily find all those photos of your Grand Aunt quickly and accurately!
This is a beginner to intermediate-level course. We will be writing a bit of code and setting up (and removing) quite a lot of infrastructure in AWS. Prior coding experience is nice to have. The course will definitely be easier to follow if you have a bit of an understanding of JavaScript (Node) and CloudFormation. For those who don’t have this experience, don’t worry – at key points in the course when we write code or modify CloudFormation templates, we will point out relevant chapters in other A Cloud Guru courses that will help you learn these areas in more detail.
In this course, you’ll learn:
* What graph databases are, and how they differ from other data storage and why/when to use them.
* How to set up and run an AWS Neptune instance.
* How to use the Gremlin and SPARQL query languages.
* How to bulk upload data into AWS Neptune.
* How to use Amazon Rekognition to analyze photos for faces.
* How to create a simple Node.js API and UI endpoint for interacting with your graph data in a web interface.
So what are you waiting for, Cloud Gurus!

 Graph database like Amazon Neptune be incredibly powerful but relatively underappreciated . in this course , we will dive in to Neptune to see how and why it might be right for your serverless application . at the end of this course you will be able to spin up a Graph Database stack and a simple web application to leverage your graph datum . we ’ll achieve this with serverless framework and cloudformation , mean you learn a lot more than just one AWS service in this course ! 
 the app we build be also great fun and very practical . it ’ a face categorisation app use family photograph ( you can use your own if you like , or use the supply image ) , leverage datum that we will generate from the Amazon Rekognition service . with this tool we might just be able to finally sort out those hundred of thousand of family photo that we all have lie around . now you can easily find all those photo of your Grand Aunt quickly and accurately ! 
 this be a beginner to intermediate - level course . we will be write a bit of code and set up ( and remove ) quite a lot of infrastructure in AWS . prior code experience be nice to have . the course will definitely be easy to follow if you have a bit of an understanding of JavaScript ( Node ) and CloudFormation . for those who do not have this experience , do not worry – at key point in the course when we write code or modify CloudFormation template , we will point out relevant chapter in other a Cloud Guru course that will help you learn these area in more detail . 
 in this course , you ’ll learn : 
 * what graph database be , and how they differ from other datum storage and why / when to use they . 
 * how to set up and run an AWS Neptune instance . 
 * how to use the Gremlin and SPARQL query language . 
 * how to bulk upload datum into AWS Neptune . 
 * how to use Amazon Rekognition to analyze photo for face . 
 * how to create a simple Node.js API and UI endpoint for interact with your graph datum in a web interface .
